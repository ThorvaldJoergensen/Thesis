(1) Spatial alignment bug fix:
Small steps! create small examples
What is a good/bad spatial alignment?
    Good:
        Orientation is equal across all sequences since the direction of the action is not important
        Make the first frame "look" forwards and have all other frames still have the information of turning
        Generality between similar sequences, they are still comparable to the original sequence after the alignment
            Diffirentiality between several actions, there is a clear detectable difference between a sitting and standing person
    Bad:
        Opposite of above??
        If the sequence is moving forwards in the coordinate space, this would need to be kept in the aligned version
            This is not relevant for our datasets as they are already aligned to the origin


(2) How to visualise body shapes of different sequences?
For manual check of temporal and spatial alignment
How do others do it?
    * Several "clip-outs" of frames with original vs aligned frames. e.g. frame 1,64,128 of a sequence
    * Show animation of first 10 frames from original and aligned version
    * Show comparison of two sequences after alignment


(3) How do others align body shape sequences?
In time and space?

Kr√ºger:
    Moving root nodes to origin and orienting the root node to the same direction
    Samples down the uniform framerate
    "Time-warped using physics-based features"??

Zhou:
    Maximizing the correlation across the sequences

Caspi:
    Rotating the sequences
    This case is of sequences of same object; E.g. zoomed in version of same sequence
    Currently using some of these princibles, because we have two different sequences performed by two different subjects.

(4) What kind of extensions/adaptations of DTW are available to align 3d body shapes?
Generalized Cononical Time Warping
Iterative Motion Warping
Dynamic Time Warping
Transform sequence down to a time series by taking one coordinate of one point foreach frame
