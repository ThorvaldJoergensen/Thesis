Right knee provided good representation for running even though scaling is not right

Right foot good for representation both classes but not for distinguishing them

Left hand bad for representation but good for distinguishing running because walking was really flat

Angles between the right hand and right shoulder over the right elbow good for initial distinguishing between walk and run (if angle < 100: try running first)

Angles between the foot and  hip over the knee, good for initial distinguishing between walk and run (if angle < 100: try running first)
