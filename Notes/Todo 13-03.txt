Read for monday 16/03:
    19.1, 19.2, 19.4, 19.5, 19.6, 19.7 (and maybe 19.11, 19.12, 19.14.2 if they are interesting)

On monday:
    implement cross validation
    Formalise quality measures on classifier
    
On Friday:
    Check the selection of steps, the logic doesnt fit the result
    Shouldn't the reference steps have the same lowest point?
    Now is the time to revisit the scaling that we do not use
